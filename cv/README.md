This app is just a demo
--------------------------------
 of one feature of what the smart contract can do. You can run it your systems. I would suggest install** truffle** using steps mentioned below and then **install Meta mask chrome extension** to check your wallet balance and also to accept the transaction, without which transaction is not complete and then copy the **mnemonics** generated when you run, **truffle develop** in your shell and then paste it in meta mask and type your password and then click on main network, in top left corner and select **Custom RPC** and add **http://localhost/9545** in that place and boom,..... You have 100 ethers per account.  
**I am not an expert in web development, so you gotta bare with me for the slopy code I have written.**
